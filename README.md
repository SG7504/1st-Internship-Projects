# 1st-Internship-Projects


As for my first project, I completed during my internship. I created a Python program to encrypt and decrypt different kinds of texts with Caesar Cipher algorithm. I applied string manipulation and file I/O to create this program. The file name is CaesarCipher.py

As for my second project, I built a tool using Python that assesses the strength of a password given by the user. The strength is determined by the presence of upper case and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters etc. The file name is PasswordChecker.py

As for my third project, I created a keylogger, that records and logs keystrokes using python. After the keys are logged they're saved in a file. The file name is KeyLoggerBasic.py

 As for my fourth project, I created a network packet sniffer tool that analyses packets and displays information like IP addresses, Domain name, payload data etc. The file name is PacketSniffer.py
